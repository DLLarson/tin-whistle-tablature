# tin-whistle-tablature
MuseScore plugin to add tablature (fingering) diagrams to a tin whistle staff in a score

This provides a plugin to automatically add fingering / tab diagrams to the notes in scores for tin whistle. The version for MuseScore 2 will adjust for tin whistles tuned to D, C and Bb, the version for MuseScore 3 does not do this and assumes a tin whistle tuned to D.

This plugin relies on a font being installed, which is not included in this download but can be obtained from Blayne Chastain's site:

To install the font it is usually just a case of double-clicking the downloaded .ttf file and agreeing to the install process.

There are two versions of this plugin. The version for MuseScore 2 will check that the staff is for  a tin whistle and adjust the tab diagram position for the lowest note possible. I have not been able to repeat this for MuseScore 3 so it just assumes that a whistle tuned to D is used - this being the most common.
